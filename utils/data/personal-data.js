From sleek frontend interfaces in React to powerful backend systems in Node.js, I enjoy working across the full web stack to bring ideas to life. I’m a fast learner with a self-driven attitude, always eager to explore new tools, frameworks, and best practices. Problem-solving is where I thrive — turning challenges into clean, scalable solutions. I believe in writing code that not only works but speaks quality. Open to opportunities that align with my skills and passion for modern web development.",
